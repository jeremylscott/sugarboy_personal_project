<h2>Sugarboy Donuts (For demonstration purposes only)</h2>

<p>
While this is actually the name of a real donut shop from the town that I live in (Prosper, TX), it is not affiliated with them or made with their permission.  It was for training and experience purposes only.  The products on the website are from a variety of sources on the internet.  They are not exclusively products sold by Sugarboy Donuts.  That being said, if you find yourself in Prosper, TX, their donuts are great!

<p>
This project was completed over the course of 2 weeks.  It is a full front to back application and is fully responsive.  This readme is meant to share some of the functionality, technologies, and features used.
</p>

<p>
This project was created via React JS.  
</p>

<p>
Other technologies used include:  Material UI, ChartJS, Stripe, Nodemailer, Axios, Massive, Postgres, Redux, CSS, and SASS.
</p>

<p>
The site was intented to imitate a real website.  The front end allows users to view all products offered on the site.  After a viewer registers for an account, they are then able to login and add items to their cart for purchase.  All prices listed are by the dozen.  and to give that business owner the ability to easily add new products to the website
