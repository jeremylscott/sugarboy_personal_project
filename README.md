<h2>Sugarboy Donuts (For demonstration purposes only)</h2>
<a>http://www.lekkerdonuts.com</a>

<p>
While this is actually the name of a real donut shop from the town that I live in (Prosper, TX), it is not affiliated with them or made with their permission.  It was for training and experience purposes only.  The products on the website are from a variety of sources on the internet.  They are not exclusively products sold by Sugarboy Donuts.  That being said, if you find yourself in Prosper, TX, their donuts are great!

This project was completed over the course of 2 weeks.  It is a full front to back application and is fully responsive.  This readme is meant to share some of the functionality, technologies, and features used.
</p>

<p>
This project was created via React JS.  
</p>

<p>
Other technologies used include:  Material UI, ChartJS, Stripe, Nodemailer, Axios, Massive, Postgres, Redux, CSS, and SASS.

<p>
The site was intented to imitate a real website.  The front end allows users to view all products offered on the site.  The Contact link shows users the two locations available as well as the contact information for both.  Also on the Contact page is a contact us form that allows them to send questions or inquiries to the company.  A viewer can click the link from the menu that allows them to register for an account.  After a viewer registers for an account, they are then able to login, and add items to their cart for purchase.  All prices listed are by the dozen.  Once items are added to their cart, the My Cart link appears and keeps track of how many items have been added.  Once the user is ready to checkout, they can click on the cart link which will take them to their cart and allow them to pay with a cc via stripe, or delete items from their cart.  

<p> 
 On the backend, users who are admins, login and are able to click on the Home page link to be taken to the Admin page.  On the admin page, they are able to add a new product, delete a product, or change a prodcuts name, description, image, price, or type.  Also on the admin page there is a link to Reports.  When they click on that link they will see a chart that shows them the amount of purchases (by the dozen) that have been purchased via the website.
